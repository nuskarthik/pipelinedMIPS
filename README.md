This is a VHDL implementation of a 32-bit MIPS processor made for a Computer Architecture course.
Implemented on FPGA using the UART wrapper.

Features implemented include Arithmetic, Logical, Conditional operations.

Implemented Pipeline for concurrent instruction processing with appropriate stalls and NOPs.
